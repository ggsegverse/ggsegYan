# ggsegYan 1.0.2

- Atlas 2D geometry migrated to the sf-optional `brain_polygons` format
  (`ggseg.formats` 0.0.3). The atlases now render without `sf` and its
  GDAL/GEOS/PROJ system libraries, enabling wasm and air-gapped installs.
  Plots are unchanged.

# ggsegYan 1.0.0

- Initial release with Yan 2023 homotopic cortical parcellation atlases
- 7-network and 17-network variants at 100-1000 parcels
